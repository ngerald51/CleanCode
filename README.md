#  Quality Code is code
Coding Organization can make or break a development organization. Countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. Hence, in my opinion, code organization can actually make or break a development team organization. 
My opinion of clean code is mainly code that is portable and easily extensible to fellow developers or team members in a project. It adheres to time-tested principles and patterns, which would lead to huge payoff in application maintainability and more allows ease of evolution of a program.

Sample of Clean Code Principles are in works.
